# Customers-Churn-Data-Prediction-Model
Predicting whether a customer will exit the bank's service using multiple Machine Learning models. The original dataset is retrieved from [Kaggle Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandshaw2001/customer-churn-dataset/data).

This repository includes:
* **README.md**
* **LICENSE**
* **Customers-Churn-Data-Prediction-Model.ipybn**: To see interactive plot, please access the [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/mainguyen2911/Customers-Churn-Data-Prediction-Model/blob/main/Customers-Churn-Data-Prediction-Model.ipynb).

What are includes in the project?
* Data Extraction and Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Build Prediction Model
  * Feature Engineering
  * Prediction Model with/without Hyperparameters Tuning.

Eventually, using Random Forest Classifer, as well as two other options (Decision Tree Classifier and Support Vector Classifier), I can reach an accuracy rate of 87% - 88%.
